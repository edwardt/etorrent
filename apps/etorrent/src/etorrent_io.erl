%% <p>A directory server (this module) is responsible for maintaining
%% the opened/closed state for each file in a torrent.</p>
%%
%% == Pieces ==
%% The directory server is responsible for mapping each piece to a set
%% of file-blocks. A piece is only mapped to multiple blocks if it spans
%% multiple files.
%%
%% == Chunks ==
%% Chunks are mapped to a set of file blocks based on the file blocks that
%% contain the piece that the chunk is a member of.
%%
%% == Scheduling ==
%% Because there is a limit on the number of file descriptors that an
%% OS-process can have open at the same time the directory server
%% attempts to limit the amount of file servers that hold an actual
%% file handle to the file it is resonsible for.
%%
%% Each time a client intends to read/write to a file it notifies the
%% directory server. If the file is not a member of the set of open files
%% the server the file server to open a file handle to the file.
%%
%% When the limit on file servers keeping open file handles has been reached
%% the file server will notify the least recently used file server to close
%% its file handle for each notification for a file that is not in the set
%% of open files.
%%
%% == Guarantees ==
%% The protocol between the directory server and the file servers is
%% asynchronous, there is no guarantee that the number of open file handles
%% will never be larger than the specified number.
%%
%% == Synchronization ==
%% The gproc application is used to keep a registry of the process ids of
%% directory servers and file servers. A file server registers under a second
%% name when it has an open file handle. The support in gproc for waiting until a
%% name is registered is used to notify clients when the file server has an
%% open file handle.
